        <p>When I was a kid, I was good at everything. I didn't realize it at the time, but this was because every task I had to do was trivial. The systems we derive success from as children are designed so that any child with a desire to succeed can do so, and I definitely had a desire.</p>

        <p>As I grew, this made me think that I not only could do everything well, but that I <em>should</em>. It created an unhealthy habit of perfectionism. This habit, I've learned, usually results in the opposite.</p>

        <p>Perfectionism promises greatness, but delivers paralysis. A perfectionist mindset breeds two distinct failure modes:</p>

        <p>1. The inability to start. Both needing perfect context and a fear of failure lead to procrastination. Greatness isn't achievable if things never get done.</p>

        <p>2. The inability to finish. Striving for perfection means work can continue forever. Greatness requires timely and frequent results.</p>

        <p>Perfectionism is a cruel irony that holds back growth. Conversely, imperfect work results in feedback and learning through iteration. This process leads to mastery, and mastery leads to greatness.</p>

        <p>Thus, the solution to perfectionism isn't lowering your standards, but being willing to put imperfect work out there with the goal of improving that imperfect work each time.</p>
        
        <p>Focus on progress, not perfection.</p>
