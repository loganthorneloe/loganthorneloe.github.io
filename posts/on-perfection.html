        <p>I've learned the pursuit of perfection inhibits greatness. Perfectionism promises excellence but generally ends in paralysis.</p>

        <p>When I was a kid, I was good at everything, but I didn't realize at the time this was because every task placed in front of me was trivial. The systems we derive success from as children are designed so that any child with the desire to succeed can do so, and I definitely had the desire.</p>

        <p>As I grew, this made me think that I not only could do everything well, but that I <em>should</em>. It created an unhealthy habit of perfectionism—a habit, I've learned, that usually results in the opposite.</p>

        <p>A perfectionist mindset breeds two distinct failure modes:</p>

        <p>1. The inability to start. Both needing perfect context and a fear of failure lead to procrastination. Greatness isn't achievable if things never get done.</p>

        <p>2. The inability to finish. Striving for an unattainable goal means work will continue forever. Those who achieve greatness do so by shipping more frequently than others.</p>

        <p>Perfectionism is a cruel irony that holds back growth. Imperfect work results in feedback and learning through iteration. This process is required for mastery.</p>

        <p>The solution to perfectionism isn't lowering your standards, but recognizing when something is good enough to ship. Good enough is better than perfect, and consistently shipping is what leads to mastery.</p>
